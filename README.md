# Webscraping using R
This is part of my series of documenting my small experiments using R and solving #DataScience problems
Lot of my experiements might be redundant and may have been already written and blogged about by someone, but this is more of a personal diary and in this process, if anyone gets inspired or learns something new then thats the best thing that could happen.
If a more knowledgeable person than me stumbles upon what i have done and thinks there is a much better way to do things, please feel free to share the feedback and i will update the feedback as post script.
